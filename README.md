# PHP
This repository is representative of my quick learning of PHP and retrieving data from mySQL. The resulting files fulfill the requirements as I understand them. I successfully deployed both on IIS and viewed the results in Chrome. 

Please note that the mysql connection information was removed in both files since my quick study did not reveal a quick way to implement password security.
